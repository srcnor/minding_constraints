            "content": "Previously: Parts I, II . A small update to my herd immunity tracker. The main change is that the data now accounts for the fact that people previously infected are getting vaccinated. I assume that past infection and vaccination are uncorrelated. This means that if, on one day a state has an estimated total infection rate of 30%, 30% of the people vaccinated on that day will have previously had the virus. The &#39;% Infected and Vaccinated&#39; data only refers to people who were infected then vaccinated, not vaccinated and contracted the virus. I&#39;m not yet modeling those who get infected after vaccination. . Infection and vaccination are not happening to random samples of the population, but I think assuming the groups are uncorrelated is a good first approximation. The main groups currently receiving the vaccine are healthcare workers, essential workers, seniors, and those with preexisting conditions. While the latter groups have likely been taking higher than average precautions (and thus have lower infection rates than the overall population), healthcare and other essential workers are some of the most exposed to the virus and will thus have higher than average infection rates. . As of February 7th, accounting for previous infection among the vaccinated lowers the estimate of immunity from 37.2% to 34.8% of the US population. . The other change is a slider to make it possible to examine the data over smaller time periods. By default, the window is set from the first day vaccines were available in the US (December 14th, 2020) to the most recent day of data, but you can use the slider to change the window to look back before the vaccine rollout or a shorter period after rollout. .

            "content": ". Previously: Tracking Progress Towards Herd Immunity . I&#39;ve updated my herd immunity tracker, the key changes are: . I&#39;ve added a line at 70%, which seems to be the closest thing to a consensus estimate for the COVID-19 herd immunity threshold, though estimates range from 50 to 90%. We should also expect to see different thresholds in different states due to the &quot;momentum&quot; of the pandemic. A state that is getting more of its immunity from vaccinations and maintaining a low level of ambient infections should see immunity begin to kick in faster than a state where the pandemic is raging. The graph will also no longer rescale on state selection, making comparison easier. | I&#39;ve changed the interpolation of vaccine data from a linear model to a more plausible simple exponential model which honestly just looks better on the graphs. A reminder that interpolation only occurs for the early dates before the CDC began releasing state by state vaccination data, so the most recent data is not modeled. | The chart should 🤞 now update daily, and will run a day or two behind the current date, aligning with the CDC&#39;s publishing schedule. | I&#39;ve also included a table below the graph with my current estimates by state to make cross state comparisons and seeing the latest data easier. | .

            "content": "As we move into what is (hopefully) the endgame of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most important question becomes: when will we be safe from the virus? . Our strategy to control the virus is to reach herd immunity, which will occur when enough people are immune to the virus that any individual contracting COVID-19 is unlikely to spread it to another individual. At this point while there may be flare ups in certain areas, the nationwide pandemic will be suppressed. . Both prior infection from COVID-19 and vaccination provide immunity from future infection, so by tracking both the cumulative number of people who have been infected and the cumulative number of people who have been vaccinated we can estimate the overall level of population immunity. The Mayo Clinic estimates that at herd immunity will be reached when 70% of the population is immune from either source. . Below is an estimate of the path towards herd immunity for the United States, and each individual state. . Data Sources . For vaccinations, this dashboard relies on the data from the CDC via Our World in Data. The data source only begins on January 12th, though US vaccinations began on December 14th. To fill in the missing data I assume each state began vaccinations on December 14th and linearly interpolate until January 12th. There are also some missing dates in the data which I have linearly interpolated. The most recent data is directly from the source and is not interpolated. . For infection estimates I&#39;m relying on the excellent covid19-projections.com by Youyang Gu. Gu&#39;s projections are based only on data on COVID-19 deaths (not hospitalizations or tests). Gu&#39;s work is used by the CDC . One limitation of Gu&#39;s approach is that the projections lag the current date by 14 days. In order to project infections in the last 2 weeks I take Gu&#39;s latest estimate of the case detection rate (positive tests/new cases) for each state and apply that to the 7 day moving average of positive tests. This approach is somewhat vulnerable to the ebb and flow of testing, but using the 7 day moving average and the fact that testing is more stable than it was earlier in the pandemic mitigate this vulnerability. . Assumptions . Beyond assuming that Gu&#39;s infection numbers are accurate, and that we can predict the last 14 days of infections by using his implied detection rates, this dashboard also assumes that immunity from infection and immunity from vaccinations are both 100% effective at preventing future COVID-19 infections. . While COVID-19 reinfections have been observed, I think the balance of the evidence finds that prior infection provides nearly complete protection from subsequent symptomatic infection. . The vaccines currently approved in the US are quite good, but not perfect with efficacy estimates between 94-95%. There is some question as to whether or not they prevent one from spreading the virus to others, but preliminary evidence suggests that they do. . In addition to 100% efficacy, the dashboard also assumes vaccine-caused immunity kicks in immediately. The currently available vaccines are both two dose vaccines, and while the first dose provides a significant measure of protection they do take time (approximately 14 days) to provide protection. . The dashboard also assumes that no one who was previously infected receives a vaccine. While people who were previously infected may choose to forgo a vaccine at this time, there is not much of an effort to exclude the previously infected from receiving doses, and in fact the CDC is currently actively recommending that previous infection not preclude one from getting vaccinated. This is probably the most impactful of the assumptions, given the large percentage of people who have been infected. .",

            "content": "In our last post, we looked at how the implied presidential election probabilities on PredictIt showed a distinct persistence throughout the presidential campaign, despite the fact that uncertainty about a future event should generally decline as the event itself approaches. . On election night itself, PredictIt shook off that persistence. . Well actually on election night itself PredictIt mostly buckled under the weight of all of the traders attempting to get in on the action: . The biggest event of election night was the calling of Florida for Trump, which occurred just before midnight Eastern Time. Traders promptly flooded the market and caused an outage at PredictIt. When the site came back online around 4AM there was significant pent up demand and volume surged. Then the presidential probabilities shook off their persistence: . Trump&#39;s odds surged immediately from 44% to 64% and got as high as 72%. Then, as it became increasingly clear that Biden would win Michigan and Wisconsin Trump&#39;s odds plummeted into the 20% range. . So throughout the campaign, the market stubbornly refused to budge in reaction to the passage of time, but when a surprising event occured the market wildly overreacted, causing a massive swing in prices that sustained for several hours before correcting. . More wild than that though, is that as of this writing the market has a Biden win at 88%, almost 2 weeks after the race was called! . PredictIt does have some structural barriers to translating prices precisely into probabilities, but these issues should show up in expanded bid/ask spreads. They shouldn&#39;t be enough to prevent the market from updating at all on the race being called for Biden by every major media source. . Based on these patterns it seems reasonable to conclude: . PredictIt markets react strongly (sometimes too strongly) to unexpected events, but don&#39;t price in the reduction of uncertainty that occurs over time. | There&#39;s a certain amount of &quot;nonreactive&quot; money in the system, probably due to partisan bias, that can prevent a functionally certain event from reaching a reasonable price. This is probably exacerbated by PredictIt limiting the number of users who can participate on each contract and limiting how much they can bet, if enough partisans get in early, there&#39;s no way for smart people or smart money to come along later and correct their errors. |",

            "content": "What are the odds that the Democratic nominee for president will win the 2032 election? If you had to guess now, you&#39;d probably say 50-50. The US has a very stable two party system, presidential elections are generally competitive and of the past 10 elections, the Democrat has won 4. . Now what are the odds that the Democratic nominee for president will win the 2020 election? In this case we have a lot more data to go on. Joe Biden has a significant lead in the polls. Donald Trump has a significant advantage due to the mechanics of the Electoral College, but most observers agree that Biden should be favored to win. A week before the election, FiveThirtyEight has Joe Biden with an 88% chance of victory, the Economist says 96%, and the betting market PredictIt says 63%. The odds differ, but all agree that a Biden win is more probable than a Trump victory. . This makes intuitive sense. Probability estimates of an event can become more certain as time goes on, because there is less intervening time for events to occur that may affect the predicted event. Think of the win probability of a football game. Generally a team with a 7 point lead is more likely to win, but their chances are much higher if they hold that lead with one minute left than if they go into halftime up a touchdown. More time on the clock means more uncertainty, all else equal. . You can see this principle quite clearly in the output of the FiveThirtyEight model. While Biden&#39;s polling lead has been fairly stable throughout the campaign there has been a steady (though not uninterrupted) increase in his odds of victory from late August onwards. . The win probabilities implied by the prices on the PredictIt betting market however do not exhibit this pattern. They have remained remarkably stable over time with the notable exception of the period in late September which coincides with the first debate (widely considered a Biden victory) and Trump&#39;s COVID diagnosis. The PredictIt market reacted suddenly to these events, but the prices do not adjust as election day approaches. . Here are the chances of a Biden victory presented from both sources, to illustrate the difference: . PredictIt has been more bullish on Trump throughout the campaign. Putting aside whether or not PredictIt is correctly pricing the probability of a Trump win, this chart presents Joe Biden&#39;s win probability indexed to his first win probability in the sample to illustrate the difference in the trend over time: . Now that we&#39;ve removed the differences between the FiveThirtyEight model we can clearly see how the two sources differ in how they evaluate the development of the race over time. Both FiveThirtyEight and PredictIt saw the race as fairly stable in August through early September. Then, Biden&#39;s odds begin to rise in the FiveThirtyEight model, but barely budged on PredictIt. The first debate and COVID diagnosis in late September showed up quickly in the PredictIt probability, and a bit later in the FiveThirtyEight probability (note the acceleration of Biden&#39;s upward trajectory in early October). Following those events Biden continued to make gains in the FiveThirtyEight model, but PredictIt movement settled down, with a modest tick back towards Trump. . Given the structure of the prediction being made here, I&#39;m inclined to say that the movement of probabilities in the FiveThirtyEight model makes more sense. As election day approaches (and more and more people have voted early) the potential for surprising events that could shake up the race decreases, and an accurate assessment of the probabilities should reflect that. This suggests an inefficiency in the PredictIt market. .",
